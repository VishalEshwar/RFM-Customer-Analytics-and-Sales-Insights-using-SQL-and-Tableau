#RFM Customer Analytics and Sales Insights using SQL and Tableau

This project analyzes sales data and performs RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation to gain insights into customer behavior and revenue patterns. The project utilizes SQL for data analysis, Tableau for data visualization, and various techniques such as subqueries, CTEs, aggregate functions, and window functions.

I delved into Kaggle sales data, applying RFM analysis to reveal significant customer behavior insights. This exploration led to pinpointing top-selling products in the U.S. and identifying high-performing sales cities. Utilizing SQL and Tableau, I condensed these findings into a user-friendly dashboard showcasing key metrics such as Annual Revenue trends, Revenue by Country and Product Line, Status-based Revenue insights, Customer Distribution across countries, Monthly Sales variations, and a detailed breakdown of Sales by Product Line. This straightforward and informative visualization is a valuable tool, empowering stakeholders with actionable sales intelligence.

Analysis Steps
1) Checked the unique values in different columns of the sales data to understand the dataset.
2) Grouped sales by various criteria (product line, year, deal size) to analyze revenue patterns.
3) Identified the best month for sales in a specific year and analyzed the performance of different product lines.
4) I analyzed RFM by calculating each customer's recency, frequency, and monetary value.
5) Assigned RFM scores to customers using NTILE and determined their segmentation based on the scores.
6) Explored products frequently sold together to identify associations or patterns using subqueries and string concatenation.
7) The additional analysis included identifying cities with the highest sales revenue in specific countries and determining the best-selling product lines.

The resulting dashboard offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of customer behavior and sales performance, enabling swift and informed strategic decisions in the ever-evolving business analytics landscape.
