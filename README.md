Sales Data Analysis and RFM Segmentation
This project focuses on analyzing sales data and performing RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation to gain insights into customer behavior and revenue patterns. The project utilizes SQL for data analysis, Tableau for data visualization, and various techniques such as subqueries, CTEs, aggregate functions, and window functions.

Introduction
In this project, we aim to gain a deep understanding of sales data by applying RFM analysis and visualizing the results. RFM segmentation is a widely used technique that groups customers based on their recency of purchase, frequency of purchase, and monetary value spent.

Analysis Steps
Checked the unique values in different columns of the sales data to understand the dataset.
Grouped sales by various criteria (product line, year, deal size) to analyze revenue patterns.
Identified the best month for sales in a specific year and analyzed the performance of different product lines during that month.
Conducted RFM analysis by calculating recency, frequency, and monetary value for each customer.
Assigned RFM scores to customers using NTILE and determined their segmentation based on the scores.
Explored products frequently sold together to identify associations or patterns using subqueries and string concatenation.
Additional analysis included identifying cities with the highest sales revenue in specific countries and determining the best-selling product lines.

Technologies Used
SQL
Tableau

Usage
Execute the SQL code provided in the code files to perform the data analysis and generate insights.
Launch Tableau and connect it to the SQL database containing the sales data.
Load the data into Tableau and create visualizations based on the analysis results.
Customize and refine the visualizations as needed.
Save and share the Tableau workbook or export the visualizations in the desired format.

Results
The analysis provided valuable insights into customer behavior, revenue patterns, and product performance. The RFM segmentation helped identify different customer segments, allowing for targeted marketing and personalized strategies. The visualizations in Tableau effectively communicate the findings, making it easier to interpret and share the results with stakeholders.
